      <p>
        I'm In√©s Manzano, a 43-year-old woman who has dedicated much of her professional life to interior design.
        For many years, I've worked helping shape spaces and transform ideas into visual and functional realities.
      </p>
      <p>
        As time went by, I felt the need to reinvent myself and seek new personal and professional challenges.
        That's why I decided to delve into the world of web development, a universe full of creative and technical possibilities.
        I'm currently enthusiastically training to turn this new passion into my second career.
